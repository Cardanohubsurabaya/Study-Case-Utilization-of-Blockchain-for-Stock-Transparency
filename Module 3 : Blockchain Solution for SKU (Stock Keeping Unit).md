<h3>What is blockchain</h3>
Imagine a giant digital notebook, but instead of one person having it, everyone in a network gets a copy. This notebook isn't for doodles, though; it's for keeping track of important stuff like who sent money to whom, who owns what, or even who voted for who in an election. Each page of this notebook is a "block," and all the blocks are linked together in a chain (hence the name!).

The cool part is that nobody can mess with the notebook once something is written in it. It's like using a pen that writes in permanent ink – every entry is set in stone. And since everyone has a copy, it's almost impossible for anyone to sneak in and change things without everyone else noticing.

<b>Blockchain systems are maintained by a swarm of nodes.</b> These nodes are computers connected to the internet that manage what’s happening on the blockchain.

The more nodes in a blockchain, the higher the chance transactions end up included in the chain since transaction inclusion is voluntary. Nodes that are creating blocks are only incentived is to collect fees but it’s up to them to choose which transactions they will include in the block and in which order. Blockchains with only a few nodes, have a higher chance that dishonest nodes are chosen to create the next block.

<h3>Introduction Relationship about blockchain and Stock Transparency</h3>

Absolutely! Here's an intro that highlights the connection between blockchain and stock transparency:

**Blockchain: The Transparency Torchbearer for Stocks**

The stock market, with its whirlwind of transactions and complex financial instruments, has long been shrouded in a veil of opacity.  For the average investor, understanding the inner workings of stock ownership and trading can feel like navigating a labyrinth.  But a technological revolution is underway, promising to shed light on these murky depths – and that revolution is called blockchain.

Blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, is more than just digital money. It's a radical new way of recording and verifying information, and it's poised to transform how we think about trust, transparency, and ownership in the stock market.

Imagine a world where every stock transaction is meticulously recorded in an unchangeable, public ledger.  Where the ownership history of every share is crystal clear, and the risk of fraud or manipulation is drastically reduced. This isn't science fiction; it's the potential future that blockchain brings to the table.

These core features make blockchain technology an ideal candidate for addressing supply chain challenges. One of the most significant benefits of blockchain in supply chain management is its transparency. Every transaction and data point is recorded in real-time, providing an unalterable and auditable trail. All parties involved in the supply chain can access this data, ensuring that everyone operates from the same source of truth. 

This transparency reduces the risk of disputes and enables swift issue resolution. Blockchain's cryptographic and consensus mechanisms make it nearly impervious to unauthorized alterations or cyberattacks. This inherent security ensures the integrity of supply chain data, safeguarding it against tampering or fraud. Unauthorized access to sensitive information becomes exceedingly difficult, bolstering data protection.
