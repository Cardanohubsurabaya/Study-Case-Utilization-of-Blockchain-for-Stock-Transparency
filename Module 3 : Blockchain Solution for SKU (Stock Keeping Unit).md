<h1>Blockchain Solution for SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)</h1>

<h3>What is blockchain</h3>
Imagine a giant digital notebook, but instead of one person having it, everyone in a network gets a copy. This notebook isn't for doodles, though; it's for keeping track of important stuff like who sent money to whom, who owns what, or even who voted for who in an election. Each page of this notebook is a "block," and all the blocks are linked together in a chain (hence the name!).

The cool part is that nobody can mess with the notebook once something is written in it. It's like using a pen that writes in permanent ink – every entry is set in stone. And since everyone has a copy, it's almost impossible for anyone to sneak in and change things without everyone else noticing.

<b>Blockchain systems are maintained by a swarm of nodes.</b> These nodes are computers connected to the internet that manage what’s happening on the blockchain.

The more nodes in a blockchain, the higher the chance transactions end up included in the chain since transaction inclusion is voluntary. Nodes that are creating blocks are only incentived is to collect fees but it’s up to them to choose which transactions they will include in the block and in which order. Blockchains with only a few nodes, have a higher chance that dishonest nodes are chosen to create the next block.
