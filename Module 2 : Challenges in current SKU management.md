<h3>Understanding Stock keeping units (SKU)</h3>

Businesses create unique SKUs for their goods and services. For example, a store that sells shoes creates internal SKUs that show a product’s details, such as color, size, style, price, manufacturer, and brand. For example, the SKU for purple Ugg boots in the Bailey Bow style, size 6, may read "UGG-BB-PUR-06."

<h3>Why is SKU importance?</h3>
Today, many retailers are equipped with portable scanners enabling salespeople to check back-of-the-store inventory by simply scanning a floor sample. Moreover, online shopping logistics are greatly improved and enhanced via SKUs.

SKUs also let shoppers compare the characteristics of similar items. For example, when a shopper buys a specific sneaker, online retailers might display similar sneakers purchased by other customers based on SKU information. This method may trigger additional purchases by the customer, thereby increasing a company’s revenue.

SKUs also allow data to be collected on sales. For example, a store can see which items are selling well and which are not based on the scanned SKUs and the POS data.

<h3>Problems encountered with the single SKU system, such as difficulties in stock audits and identification of missing products. </h3>
There are some weaknesses in the existing SKU. One of them in terms of transparency.

Generally 1 type of goods has 1 type of SKU. The absence of a differentiator between product A products b. For more details we can see the following example

1 type of product only has 1 type of SKU. Even though 1 type of product can number more than 1 piece. Even if the product has variations. Generally SKU is only distinguished into types of variations. not in the quantity number. This makes when an audit of stock is held, often business actors do not know which items are missing

Yet if we can distinguish the SKU into Quantity, this is very useful for tracing our stock of goods. Business actors can find out the goods with the SKU code what is lost, damaged etc.
